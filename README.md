# Polypharmacy Side Effects Analysis and Prediction

A comprehensive machine learning framework for analyzing polypharmacy interactions and predicting drug side effects.

## Overview

This project provides tools for:
- **Data Analysis**: Comprehensive exploration of polypharmacy side effects data
- **Predictive Modeling**: Multiple machine learning models for side effect prediction
- **Risk Assessment**: Clinical decision support for drug interaction evaluation
- **Network Analysis**: Drug interaction network visualization and analysis

## Features

### 1. Basic Analysis (`polypharmacy_analysis.py`)
- Data exploration and visualization
- Feature engineering for drug interactions
- Multiple classification models (Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- Network analysis of drug interactions
- Medical insights generation

### 2. Advanced Modeling (`advanced_models.py`)
- Ensemble methods (Voting Classifier, Stacking Classifier)
- Neural Networks (MLPClassifier)
- Deep Learning models (TensorFlow/Keras)
- Model comparison and evaluation
- Advanced feature engineering

### 3. Risk Assessment (`risk_assessment.py`)
- Clinical decision support system
- Risk scoring based on severity and affected systems
- Contraindication checking
- Clinical recommendations generation
- Exportable clinical reports

## Data Structure

The system expects CSV data with the following columns:
- `STITCH_1`: First drug identifier
- `STITCH_2`: Second drug identifier  
- `Polypharmacy_Side_Effect`: Side effect code
- `Side_Effect_Name`: Human-readable side effect name

## Models Available

### Classification Models
1. **Random Forest**: Ensemble method for robust predictions
2. **Gradient Boosting**: Sequential learning for high accuracy
3. **Logistic Regression**: Linear model for interpretable results
4. **Support Vector Machine**: High-dimensional classification
5. **Neural Networks**: Multi-layer perceptron for complex patterns
6. **Deep Learning**: Advanced neural networks with TensorFlow

### Prediction Tasks
- **Side Effect Prediction**: Predict specific side effects from drug combinations
- **Severity Classification**: Classify severity (mild, moderate, severe)
- **System Classification**: Predict affected body system

## Risk Assessment Features

### Risk Scoring
- Severity-based scoring (mild=1, moderate=2, severe=3)
- System-based risk factors (cardiovascular=3, respiratory=3, etc.)
- Combined risk score calculation

### Clinical Guidelines
- Absolute and relative contraindications
- Monitoring requirements (frequent, regular)
- Dose adjustment recommendations

### Patient Factors
- Age considerations (elderly patients)
- Organ function adjustments (kidney, liver)
- Comorbidity considerations

## Usage Examples

### Basic Analysis
```python
from polypharmacy_analysis import PolypharmacyAnalyzer

analyzer = PolypharmacyAnalyzer('polypharmacy_data.csv')
analyzer.load_and_explore_data()
analyzer.create_features()
analyzer.visualize_data()
analyzer.train_predictive_models()
```

### Advanced Modeling
```python
from advanced_models import AdvancedPolypharmacyPredictor

predictor = AdvancedPolypharmacyPredictor('polypharmacy_data.csv')
results = predictor.get_model_comparison()
prediction = predictor.predict_drug_interaction('CID000002173', 'CID000003345')
```

### Risk Assessment
```python
from risk_assessment import DrugInteractionRiskAssessment

risk_tool = DrugInteractionRiskAssessment('polypharmacy_data.csv')
assessment = risk_tool.assess_risk('CID000002173', 'CID000003345')
risk_tool.export_clinical_report(assessment)
```

## Output Files

The system generates several output files:
- `processed_polypharmacy_data.csv`: Enhanced dataset with features
- `model_performance.csv`: Model comparison results
- `medical_insights.txt`: Clinical insights and findings
- `polypharmacy_analysis.png`: Comprehensive visualizations
- `risk_database.json`: Structured risk information
- `clinical_report_*.txt`: Individual clinical reports

## Model Performance

The system provides comprehensive model evaluation including:
- Accuracy scores
- Cross-validation results
- Confusion matrices
- Classification reports
- Feature importance analysis

## Clinical Applications

### For Healthcare Providers
- Pre-prescription risk assessment
- Drug interaction screening
- Patient monitoring recommendations
- Clinical decision support

### For Researchers
- Drug interaction pattern discovery

- Drug interaction counseling
- Risk communication to patients
- Alternative therapy suggestions

## Installation Requirements

```python
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn networkx tensorflow joblib
```

## Data Privacy and Security

- All patient data should be de-identified
- Follow HIPAA guidelines for healthcare data
- Implement appropriate access controls
- Regular security audits recommended

## Limitations

- Predictions based on available interaction data
- Not a replacement for clinical judgment
- Requires validation with real-world outcomes
- May not capture rare interactions

## Future Enhancements

- Integration with electronic health records
- Real-time monitoring capabilities
- Mobile application development
- Natural language processing for clinical notes
- Integration with drug databases (DrugBank, etc.)
